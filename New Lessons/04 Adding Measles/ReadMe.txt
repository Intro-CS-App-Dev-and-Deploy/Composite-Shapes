NOTE: be sure to review the Face Pieces 
- These might eventually be put in a single procedure

Teaching Method
- create variables in subprogram, then move them to population
- X&Y: logical rectangle with radius consideration

TEACHER Directed: adding the measles
- start wtih drawing measle anywhere, diameter is from smallerDimension
- remove stroke
- add red colour (median red colour on RGB)
- add random red colour, range of red (most pink, most red, etc.)
- create night mode measles colour
- create range of night mode red color
- use ternary operator to switch night mode measles colour
- CAUTION: ternary should be applied to all colour pieces of face, background image, any forground images, text, and buttons with hover over
- X & Y are chosen randomly in logical reactangle

Advanced
- Check if X & Y are inside equation for circle, give equation for circle
- ( x-h )^2 + ( x-k )^2 = r^2
- Note: h,k is centerX & centerY
