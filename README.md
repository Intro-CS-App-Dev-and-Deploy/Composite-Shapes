# Composite-Shapes
Combining Rectangles and other 2D Primitives into ...

## Questions
- Using my case study, I can layout rectangles, circles, or lines and develop my GUI based on visual data (rectangles) and named variables ( `rect()` parameters )
  - Using `ellipse()`, I might find the center of my object and code ellipse-circle parameters
  - Using `line()`, I might find the endpoints and distance of my object, in parameters
- Using my 2D Primitive Shapes, I will layout other shapes based on parameters, i.e. formulae
 instead
   - Example: `triangle()`
- Once ellipse-Measles are drawn, how do they stay out of the eyes, nose, or mouth?
- How do ellipse-Measles on the face? (or what else needs to be drawn to hide the measles occurring in the rectangle)

TBA
- Using my flat program, I will develop a dynamic program
- [Enrichment] Using my dynamic program, I will create subprograms attempting to ease human reading

## Expectations
- Variable Population: focus is entering values into one variable and using that variable in other variables
- CAUTION: each variable must be figured out, one at a time
  - Use paperfolding to imagine ratios
  - There is more than one answer
- Modular Programming: able to program without affecting other lines of code
- START: rectangles, circles, or lines named for their represented object
  - See Prototyping 2D Primitives for simple rectangle with inscribed circle
  - See Associated Video building this from paper folding
- Create a Flat Static Program with a Face and one measle
  - See Flat Measles Exemplar

## Instructions, Vocabulary, & Explanations (Including URLs and IDE Use)
- See Prototyping 2D Primitives for simple rectangle with inscribed circle to illustrate Variable Population
- Measles Project: easier to paperfold centers of circles than rectangles
  - See Mr. Mercer for alternatives

## Blocks of code, Emphasized Functions
