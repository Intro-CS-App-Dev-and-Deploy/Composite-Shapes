# Composite-Shapes
Combining Rectangles and other 2D Primitives into ...

## Questions
- Using my case study, I will layout rectangles ( `rect()` ) and develop my GUI based on visual data (rectangles) and named variables ( `rect()` parameters)
- Using my rect(), I will layout individual shapes based on rectangle parameters, i.e. formulae


TBA
- Using my flat program, I will develop a dynamic program
- [Enrichment] Using my dynamic program, I will create subprograms attempting to ease human reading
