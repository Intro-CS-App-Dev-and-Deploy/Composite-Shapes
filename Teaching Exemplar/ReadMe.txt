Progressions
- Review display geometry and display orientation
- Note: for testing purposes need to move between fullScreen() and size()
- Note: introduce ternary operator as option for populating based on IF-ELSE structure
- Note: intro println for prototyping instructions to turn phone based on orientation
- Face circle and finding the center of the canvas (paper) with ratios
- Face retangle: laying out division of app
- Left Eye, Right Eye as ratios of canvas
- Mouth as line, strokeWieght as function, parameter as ratio based on ratio of smallerDimension
  - Note: able to figure out ratios using calculator from display geometry
- Nose as 3-coordinates of ratios (not actual numbers) based on face

Drawing measle
- review ellipse()
- intro fill(), noStroke(), stroke(), and "reseting defaults
- introduce random()
- introduce concepts of "half-off screen" and "only in division of face"

To think about: only on face, not on eyes, mouth, or nose
